I've just deployed [dumaurier/pwa_jekyll](https://github.com/dumaurier/pwa_jekyll), using its "Deploy to Netlify" feature.

It has a CMS:

Personally, I prefer configuring the files and folders, directly.. but I will explore that further.

I will document my use of this theme and it's [Indieweb](https://web-work.tools/indieweb) Features, and use this site for information around Agoric, Mark Miller, and Object Capabilities.

In part, I put this together quickly so it would be deployed for [Indieweb Summit](https://2019.indieweb.org/) and have a chance to demonstrate and learn about its function with other remote participants.

Since I have two other indieweb sites, ideally I should figure out about getting them to talk with eachother, and the rest of the indieweb.
